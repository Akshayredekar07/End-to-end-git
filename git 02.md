DevOps Cycle is an infinite loop where everything is continuous.

## Version Control System Tools:
Version control systems are also known as:
- Software Configuration Management (SCM)
- Source Code Management (SCM)

## Need for Version Control Systems

- Benefits of version control systems.

## Types of Version Control Systems
1. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
2. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

Q. **Difference between CVCS and DVCS**

## Need for Version Control Systems
As developers, we often write several files containing source code. 
- Developer → Write Code → Files

### Client Project Example
- Client provided requirements to Durga to develop a project.
- Client project consists of 100 files developed.
- The client suggested some changes.
- I modified some files' source code to meet the client's requirements.
- I gave a demo, and the client suggested more changes.
- I modified some files' source code again to meet the client's requirements.
- I gave a third demo.
- The client requested the first version only.

### Importance of Version Control
- We should not overwrite our code; every version must be maintained.
1. Maintaining multiple versions manually is a complex activity.
2. If Developer A and Developer B are working on the same code, we need to merge their contributions. If both developers create a file named `Util.java`, one copy will overwrite the other, leading to abnormal behavior.
3. Every change should be tracked, including:
   - Who made the change
   - When the change was made
   - What changes were made
4. Overwriting of code should not happen.
5. Developers must share their code with peers to enable collaborative work.
6. Parallel development is essential.
