 Need of Version Control System?
Being a developer we have to write several files which contains source code.
Developer  Write Code  Files
Client gave requirement to Durga to develop a project
client project
 |--100 files developed
 |- client suggested some changes
 |- I changed some files source code to meet client requirement
 |- I gave the demo and client suggested some more changes
 |- I changed some files source code to meet client requirement
 |- I gave demo 3rd time
 |- Client asked for first version only
 |- My Face with big ????
We should not overwrite our code.
Every version we have to maintain.
1) Maintaining multiple versions manually is very complex activity.
2) Dev-A and Dev-B working on the code. At last we have to merge the code developed
by both developers and we have to deliver to the client. If both developers developed 
a file named with Util.java, then one copy will overwrite with another copy, which 
creates abnormal behaviour. We should not overwrite our code.
2) Every change should be tracked like
 who did the change
 when he did the change
 which changes he did etc
 and all changes should be maintained.
3) Overwriting of the code should not be happend.
4) Developers have to share their code to peer developers, so that multiple developers 
will work in collaborative way.
5) Parallel development must be required


How Version Control System will work? Version control system always talks about files which contain source code. Everyone required version control system to maintain different versions of their document.  tester  To maintain different versions of test script Architect  To maintain different versions of Documents Project Manager  To maintain different versions of Excel sheets etc
